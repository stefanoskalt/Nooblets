- First working version of collision has been iimplemented
	- Cast a ray. 
	- It returns an array of its results If it hits an object (contained to the modelsCollision) 
	- If it hits an object it will show "HIT!" in the top of the screen
	Note: The only model it has collusion is the desk
- Modularity:
	- Each model can be loaded by calling the loadModel() function 
-Refactoring:
	- All models will now be loaded from the loadAllModels() function
- Implemented a crosshair to show the camera direction. This crosshair can show us 
  where the ray is casting to and thus we can aim it to the object and test it
